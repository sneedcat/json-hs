#json-hs

This is a simple JSON parser written in Haskell. The parser in Parser.hs was handwritten using parser combinators, which was a good exercise in understanding how to build parsers from scratch.

The Main.hs file was created with the help of AI to run a comprehensive set of tests on the parser. It's only there to verify that the library works correctly and doesn't serve any other purpose.

To use it, you can compile and run the project to see the test results. It covers various JSON structures, including valid and invalid cases.
